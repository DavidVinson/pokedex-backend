itself by scattering its poisonous scales and
fluttering its wings."

direction with a glare from its upraised head."
24,Arbok,35.00,650.00,Cobra Pokemon,"This Pokemon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things

wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace
is impossible."

stressed now and then if itâ€™s unable to fully
discharge the electricity."

headaches. The more pain itâ€™s in, the more

energy to fuel it as it runs great distances.

should train this Pokemon to walk every day."
61,Poliwhirl,10.00,200.00,Tadpole Pokemon,"It marches over the land in search of bug
Pokemon to eat. Then it takes them underwater
so it can dine on them where itâ€™s safe."
62,Poliwrath,13.00,540.00,Tadpole Pokemon,"Its percentage of body fat is nearly zero. Its
body is entirely muscle, which makes it heavy
and forces its swimming prowess to develop."

momentum, its speed can exceed 60 mph."

This Pokemon becomes stronger by stumbling and
falling to keep up with its parent."

of adversity."
108,Lickitung,12.00,655.00,Licking Pokemon,"Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will

art, led local people to spread rumors that this
Pokemon may be an invader from outer space."
